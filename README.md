ORM Lite Android Gradle Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephanenicolas/ormlite-android-gradle-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephanenicolas/ormlite-android-gradle-plugin)[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.stephanenicolas.ormgap/ormgap-plugin/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.stephanenicolas.ormgap/ormgap-plugin)
--------
========

A Gradle plugin for Android to generate an ORMLite configuration file and boost DAOs creations.

### Usage 

```xml
//build.gradle

buildscript {
  repositories {
    ...
    mavenCentral()
  }

  dependencies {
    ...
    classpath 'com.github.stephanenicolas.ormgap:ormgap-plugin:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'android'
apply plugin: 'ormgap'
...

```

### Example

An example can be found [in the GH repo](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/ormlite-android-gradle-plugin/tree/master/ormgap-example).

### Benchmarking

Our plan is to make a benchmarking app using th example android app.

For now, we can only give you a number from our experience at Groupon: the average gain, for all devices of our 50 million users is 10 ms per DAO creation. It might not seem much, but for large apps, it makes a difference. In our app, we gained 400 ms with ORMGAP.

### CI

Travis is almost ready at : https://travis-ci.org/stephanenicolas/ormlite-android-gradle-plugin
